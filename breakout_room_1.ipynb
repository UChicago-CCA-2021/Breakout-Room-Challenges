Under Nadella's leadership, Microsoft underwent a cultural transformation which also translated into improving company performance.

    "\n",
    "1. Employees adopt a \"learn-it-all\" (growth) mindset rather than a \"know-it-all\" mindset.\n",
    "2. The work environment becomes more \"collaborative\" and less \"competitive\" or \"cut-throat\".\n",

    "You can download the csv file of Microsoft's Glassdoor review from 2008 to 2018 [here](https://github.com/william-wei-zhu/glassdoor_reviews/blob/main/microsoft_year.csv).
